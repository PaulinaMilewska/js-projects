            <p>Think about the naughtiest thing your dog ever did. For me, it’s the time my dog Ralph got into the
                kitchen cupboard while I was out and tossed a bag of flour all over the house. I was frustrated when I
                came home to a find flour ground into the carpet, but then Ralph looked up at me with those big, round
                eyes, flour dusting her adorable nose, her sweet, soft ears flopping over as she tilted her head…how
                could I stay mad at a face like that?

                Cuteness. It’s what makes us squee over puppy pics and rush to forgive our pets for the occasional
                naughty misstep. But why are dogs so cute? What is it about man’s best friend that turns even the
                toughest tough guy into a babytalking fool every time his dog rolls over for a belly rub? It turns out
                the science of cute is fascinating stuff.</p><br>
            <h2 id="cute-causes">What Makes a Dog Cute</h2>
            <p>Even without a handy list of cuteness cues, most of us have an innate sense of what’s cute and what’s
                not. You look at a sweet, fluffy dog and you just know: that thing is cute. Or you might look at a snake
                and think: so not cute. Where the science of cute gets really interesting is when we start to consider
                why certain features tickle our squee response.
                It all goes back to human babies. As explained by Natalie Angier in the New York Times, the features of
                cuteness are those that express “extreme youth, vulnerability, harmlessness and need,” and those
                features elicit a nurturing response. In other words, stuff that reminds us of small, defenseless babies
                will trigger warm feelings that make us want to take care of whatever made us go “awww.”

                The thing is, our brain doesn’t automatically know the difference between “human baby” and “vulnerable
                creature from another species.” If you look at a picture of a puppy and a baby, you’re going to feel the
                same warm, fuzzy feelings for both.</p><br>
            <h2 id="cute-symptoms">How Dogs Got So Cute</h2>
            <p>Wait a minute, you might be thinking, my dog isn’t helpless. Sometimes I think she’s smarter than me!
                It’s true, possessing the features of kinderschema doesn’t automatically mean a dog is weak or helpless.
                Some studies have sought to prove that dogs evolved to be cuter as they became domesticated in order to
                make people want to take care of them.

                It makes sense, doesn’t it, that dogs would become increasingly cute as they became increasingly
                dependent on human beings to survive? A reported by the Huffington Post, one UK research team found that
                shelter dogs who “actively raised their inner brow and widened their eyes” were adopted faster. Raised
                brow, wide eyes…sounds like a cute cue to me! The study theorized that “dogs’ facial movements have
                evolved in response to a human preference for child-like characteristics,” meaning the cuter the dog,
                the more willing the human will be to look after it.

                These studies are still relatively new, with small sample sizes, so we can’t say for sure that you are
                compelled by cuteness to look after your dog. But I have to admit, when I come home from work to find an
                overturned trash can and a dog looking up at me with those big, round.</p><br>
            <h2 id="cuteness">Cuteness Is In the Eye of the Beholder</h2>
            <p>Of course, plenty of us love dogs who aren’t conventionally cute. Even “ugly” dogs elicit a caregiving
                response from their human caretakers, possibly because,
                despite their less conventionally attractive features, they’re just so vulnerable.

                In addition, some people have different cuteness cues than others. I’m conjecturing here, but given our
                brain’s response to “cute cues” and our innate need to nurture, it seems possible that cuteness isn’t
                just a
                list of attributes. Cuteness is a state of being.</p><br>
